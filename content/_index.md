## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am a final year computer science student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong interested in distributed systems, software engineering, and generally the more applied side of computer science. I developed software projects ranging from web apps, mobile apps, to games and chat bots. Currently working on a web-based multiplayer monopoly game (using Go and Godot) as my final year project.

I also enjoy drawing, writing, reading novels and listening to music (mostly British alt rock) in my free time.

## Work Experience
#### Google Summer of Code Intern with Anita Borg's Institute
2017.06-2017.08 (Remote)

This was an internship organized by Google to match students with open source organizations. I was selected to work on an open source iOS educational mobile game in Anita Borg's Institute.

I worked in an international team of 10 members and gained invaluable experiences in remote collaboration, version controlling, and the workflow of open source software.

I also won **Anita Borg's Institute Best Coder Award for Google Summer of Code 2017** upon completing the internship.
